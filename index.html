    <h2 class="fnt">What FOSS is?</h2></div>
    <p class="fn">>> FOSS stands for Free and Open Source Software, which is software that is distributed freely with a license that
    allows users to modify, study, and redistribute the source code. FOSS often comes with no cost and can be used and
    modified in any way. The most popular FOSS programs include the Linux operating system, the Apache web server, and the
    MySQL database. FOSS is important because it gives users the freedom to customize their software and encourages
        collaboration between developers and also fix bugs.</p>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align:center">
    <h2 class="fnt">Foss benefits over proprietary software:</h2></div>
    <p class="fn">>> Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) offers numerous benefits over proprietary software. One of the primary advantages
    is that FOSS is generally available for free, making it more accessible to a wider range of users. This accessibility
    can lead to greater innovation, as developers and users can freely modify and customize the software to meet their
    specific needs.
    <br>
    <br>
    >> Another benefit of FOSS is that it is often more secure than proprietary software. Because the source code is openly
    available, security experts can review and identify any potential vulnerabilities, which can be fixed quickly. In
    contrast, proprietary software often relies on a company's security team to identify and address security issues, which
    can take longer and may not always be successful.
    <br>
    <br>
    >> FOSS also promotes collaboration and community building, as developers and users can share knowledge and resources to
    improve the software. This can lead to a more robust and stable software ecosystem, with a larger pool of contributors
    working to ensure the software is continually updated and maintained.
    <br>
    <br>
    >> Finally, FOSS allows for greater freedom and control over software usage. Users are free to modify and distribute the
    software as they see fit, without being restricted by proprietary licensing agreements or vendor lock-in. This can lead
    to more flexibility and autonomy in software usage, as users can tailor the software to meet their unique needs and
    preferences.
    <br>
    <br>
    >> Overall, FOSS offers numerous benefits over proprietary software, including greater accessibility, security,
    collaboration, and freedom of usage. These advantages make FOSS an attractive option for individuals, organizations, and
    governments looking to use reliable and innovative software solutions.</p>

    <div style="text-align:center">
    <h2 class="fnt">History of development of FOSS:</h2>
    </div>
    <p class="fn">>> The history of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) dates back to the early days of computing. In the 1960s and 70s,
    computer programs were primarily developed by universities and research institutions, and were freely shared among the
    community. This culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing helped pave the way for the development of FOSS.
    <br>
    <br>
    >> In the 1980s, proprietary software became more prevalent as companies like Microsoft and Apple began to dominate the
    market. This led to concerns about vendor lock-in and a lack of transparency and control over software. In response, a
    group of developers led by Richard Stallman launched the GNU project, which aimed to create a completely free and open
    source operating system.
    <br>
    <br>
    >> In the 1990s, the GNU project was combined with the Linux kernel to create the first fully functional open source
    operating system, known as GNU/Linux. This operating system became increasingly popular among developers and users, and
    helped spur the growth of the FOSS movement.
    <br>
    <br>
    >> In the early 2000s, the popularity of FOSS continued to grow, with many businesses and organizations adopting open
    source software for its cost-effectiveness, reliability, and flexibility. The development of FOSS also led to the
    creation of numerous open source communities and organizations, such as the Apache Software Foundation and the Linux
    Foundation, which continue to support and promote the growth of FOSS today.
    <br>
    <br>
    >> Today, FOSS is a major force in the world of software development and technology, with countless projects and
    initiatives dedicated to promoting open source values and principles. The history of FOSS is a testament to the power of
    collaboration, innovation, and community building, and continues to inspire and shape the future of technology.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align:center">
    <h2 class="fnt">FOSS alternatives to common applications:</h2></div>
    <p class="fn">>> Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) provides a wealth of alternatives to many popular proprietary applications. For
    example, instead of using Microsoft Office for word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations, users can choose to use
    LibreOffice or Apache OpenOffice, both of which are free and offer many of the same features as Microsoft Office.
    <br>
    <br>
    >> For graphic design and image editing, GIMP is a powerful and feature-rich alternative to Adobe Photoshop. In addition,
    Inkscape is a vector graphics editor that can be used for creating logos, diagrams, and other graphics.
    <br>
    <br>
    >>For video editing, Blender and Kdenlive are both open source alternatives to proprietary video editing software. Blender
    is also a 3D modeling and animation software.
    <br>
    <br>
    >> Firefox is a widely used open source web browser, while Chromium and Brave are other popular open source browser
    alternatives.
    <br>
    <br>
    >> For email clients, Thunderbird is a free and open source email client developed by Mozilla, while Evolution and KMail
    are other open source options.
    <br>
    <br>
    >> FOSS also offers alternatives for software development tools such as Git for version control, Eclipse for integrated
    development environment, and MySQL for database management.
    <br>
    <br>
    >> The Tor Project is one such project, which provides a free and open source software for enabling anonymous communication
    and browsing on the internet. The Tor network routes traffic through multiple relays, making it difficult to trace the
    source of the communication.
    <br>
    <br>
    >> Another FOSS project focused on privacy and security is Mullvad VPN. Mullvad VPN is an open source VPN client that
    provides a secure and private connection to the internet. It uses strong encryption and does not log user activity,
    ensuring that users' online activities remain private and secure.
    <br>
    <br>
    >> FOSS provides users with cost-effective, flexible, and customizable solutions for their software needs, while also promoting the values of
    transparency, collaboration, and community building.</p>
    <br>

    <div style="text-align:center">
    <h2 class="fnt">FOSS ties with GNU/Linux:</h2>
    <p class="fn">>> GNU software was a critical step in the creation of the first fully functional open source operating system, GNU/Linux.
    In the early 1990s, Linux kernel was developed, which was later combined with the GNU software to create the first fully
    functional open source operating system, GNU/Linux. The GNU/Linux operating system is highly customizable, flexible, and
    secure, making it a popular choice for developers, organizations, and individuals who value the principles of FOSS. The
    close ties between FOSS and GNU/Linux continue to shape the future of technology and software development.</p></div>
