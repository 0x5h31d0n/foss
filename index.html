    <h2><div style="text-align:center"><p>FOSS stands for Free and Open Source Software, which is software that is distributed freely with a license that
    allows users to modify, study, and redistribute the source code. FOSS often comes with no cost and can be used and
    modified in any way. The most popular FOSS programs include the Linux operating system, the Apache web server, and the
    MySQL database. FOSS is important because it gives users the freedom to customize their software and encourages
        collaboration between developers and also fix bugs.</p></div><h2>
